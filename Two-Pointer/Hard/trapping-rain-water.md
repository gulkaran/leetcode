# Trapping Rain Water <img align="right" height="50" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/LeetCode_Logo_1.png"/>

This question is a doozy, but it uses a two pointer approach based on the intuition that you can calculate how much rain can be trapped at any position $i$ if you know the maximum left and right heights. This is because you can store potentially up to the max heights, bottlenecked by the lower max height.

### Example

We can use an $O(n)$ memory solution where we store the max right and max left in arrays, however, noticing this small trick will net us an $O(1)$ memory solution.

### Optimal Solution

- start with left and right pointers (l = 0, r = len(height) - 1)
- have starting maxLeft and maxRight variables
- move the pointer which has the **minimum** value
- since weâ€™ve moved the pointer with the lower value, we are allowed to calculate the rain that position can capture using the max value of the pointer we moved, as the bottleneck.
  - but how? what about the other max value? Since we moved the pointer with the **lower** value, we know the OTHER pointer was larger (or same) so this positionâ€™s calculated rain can only be **bottlenecked** by the pointer we just moved.
- notes:
  - imagine a left staircase ðŸ“¶, as we update the lMax, we donâ€™t need to update the rain counter as the rain would trickle off to the left of it. Our calculation of rain would yield us a negative number.
    - we still do the calculation in code for cleaner code but it always adds 0
  - key point is we move the side of the lower max value because weâ€™re bottlenecked by that side!

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height)-1
        lMax, rMax = height[l], height[r]
        rain = 0

        while l < r:
            if lMax < rMax:
                l += 1
                lMax = max(lMax, height[l])
                rain += lMax - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                rMax = max(rMax, height[r])
                rain += rMax - height[r]

        return rain
```

Note by updating the max values before calculating the rain, we ignore the possibility of negative heights and ignore checking that condition
