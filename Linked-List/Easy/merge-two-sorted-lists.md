# Merge Two Sorted Lists

[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

The concept is to create a third result Linked List, and keep track of a tail node. Using the same logic as the merge function in merge sort, we assign the smaller value to the tail. Donâ€™t forget to increment the tail. 

Once we reach the end of one of the lists, we can simply copy the rest of the other list.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
 
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        c1 = list1
        c2 = list2
        res = ListNode()
        tail = res
        
        # base case
        if c1 is None:
            return c2
        elif c2 is None:
            return c1

        # similar to merge sort
        while c1 is not None and c2 is not None:
            if c1.val > c2.val:
                tail.next = c2
                c2 = c2.next

            else:
                tail.next = c1
                c1 = c1.next

            tail = tail.next

        # copy over the rest since one list reached its end
        if c1 is None:
            tail.next = c2
            
        elif c2 is None:
            tail.next = c1
        
        return res.next
```
